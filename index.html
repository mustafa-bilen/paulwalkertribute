        Paul William Walker IV[1] (September 12, 1973[2] â€“ November 30, 2013)
        was an American actor. He was known for his role as Brian O'Conner in
        the Fast & Furious franchise. Walker began his career as a child actor
        in the 1980s, gaining recognition in the 1990s after appearing in the
        television soap opera The Young and the Restless; he received praise for
        his performances in the teen comedy She's All That and the comedy-drama
        Varsity Blues (both 1999), and saw international fame by starring in The
        Fast and the Furious (2001). Walker also starred in the commercially
        successful road thriller Joy Ride (2001), becoming an action star. He
        followed this with the box-office disappointments Into the Blue (2005)
        and Running Scared (2006), although he earned praise for his performance
        in the survival drama Eight Below, and for his portrayal of Hank Hansen
        in Flags of Our Fathers (both 2006). Outside of these, Walker largely
        appeared in low budget action films, but starred in the commercially
        successful heist film Takers (2010). Walker died of injuries sustained
        from a single-vehicle collision on November 30, 2013, while speeding.
        His father and daughter filed separate wrongful death lawsuits against
        Porsche, which resulted in settlements. At the time of his death, Walker
        had not completed filming Furious 7 (2015); it was released after
        rewrites and stand-ins, including his brothers Cody and Caleb, both of
        whom filled in for Walker, while the song "See You Again" by Wiz Khalifa
        and Charlie Puth was commissioned as a tribute.[3]
